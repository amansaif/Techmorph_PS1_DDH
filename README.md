# 🌍 Climate Change EDA – Deep Data Hackathon 2.0

## 📌 Problem Statement

Climate change is accelerating due to rising temperatures and extreme weather. Environmental degradation is driven by carbon emissions, deforestation, and fossil fuel use. Billions of people worldwide are affected by climate-related disruptions.

Current policies often lack integration, evidence, and long-term effectiveness. Governments and organizations need **data-driven strategies** to reduce emissions and mitigate risks.

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

We built a **Climate Intelligence Dashboard** that transforms raw climate data into actionable insights.

Key features:

* **Interactive EDA platform** → explore climate trends dynamically
* **Multi-dimensional analysis engine** → track 10+ key climate variables across countries & time
* **Policy impact simulator** → visualize outcomes of interventions
* **Country-specific recommendation system** → tailored climate action strategies

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Conduct comprehensive climate analysis by exploring links between emissions, temperature, renewables, and extreme weather
* Generate 10+ evidence-based insights to guide climate policy
* Present findings through an **interactive, judge-friendly dashboard**
* Provide **specific, implementable recommendations** for climate action
* Deliver professional outputs: Python code, dashboard, and policy brief

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python Ecosystem** → Pandas, NumPy (data processing & analysis)
* **Visualization Libraries** → Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly (statistical + interactive charts)
* **Dashboard Frameworks** → Streamlit, Power BI
* **Geographic Mapping** → Folium (climate maps)
* **Environment** → Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Quality Assessment** → load datasets, identify missing values, handle outliers
2. **Structured EDA** → 10+ univariate, bivariate, multivariate analyses
3. **Pattern Recognition** → correlation analysis, trend identification, anomaly detection
4. **Interactive Visualizations** → dynamic charts, geographic heatmaps, time-series animations
5. **Actionable Insights** → translate findings into climate policy recommendations
